    <h1>California Roll Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./images/california-sushi-rolls-square.jpg" alt="delicious california sushi roll" height="300" width="400">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>California roll (カリフォルニアロール / 加州巻き, Kariforunia rōru / Kashū maki) or California maki contains imitation crab 
        (or rarely real crab), avocado, and cucumber. Sometimes crab salad is substituted for the crab stick. 
        In America it comes as uramaki (inside-out makizushi roll) and often the outer layer of rice is sprinkled with 
        toasted sesame seeds or roe (such as tobiko from flying fish). Outside America, California rolls may be closer to the 
        traditional design or Futomaki, with nori seaweed on the outside.
        As one of the most popular styles of sushi in the United States and Canada, 
        the California roll has been influential in sushi's global popularity, and in inspiring sushi chefs around the world to
        create non-traditional fusion cuisine.[2]</p>

        <ul>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li> 2 cups uncooked white rice</li>
            <li>½ cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>masago (capelin roe)</li>
            <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon wasabi paste</li>
            <li>¼ pound cooked crab meat, drained of excess liquid and shredded</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Wrap a sushi rolling mat completely in plastic wrap and set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer rice to a bowl and cut in vinegar using a rice paddle or wooden spoon. Season with sugar and salt. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine crab meat with mayonnaise in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Place nori sheet on a flat work surface. Spread a thin layer of rice on top of nori.</li>
            <li>Place nori, rice side down, on the prepared rolling mat. Place 2 to 3 avocado slices on top of the nori in one layer..</li>
            <li>Top with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the crab mixture.</li>
            <li>Spoon 1 to 2 teaspoons tobiko lengthwise on one side of the avocado-crab mixture, and 2 cucumber strips on the other side.</li>
            <li>Using the mat as a guide, carefully roll the California roll into a tight log. Remove the rolling mat. Top roll with more tobiko, cover with plastic wrap, and gently press the tobiko into the top of the roll.</li>
            <li>Remove the plastic and cut into 6 even pieces using a wet knife. Repeat with remaining sheets of nori and filling. Serve garnished with pickled ginger, soy sauce, and wasabi paste.</li>
        </ol>
